Blitz Generative is helping push the boundaries on crypto-native generative artwork.

Generative art has existed since the first years of computing (e.g. the [Minksytron](https://www.masswerk.at/minskytron/)) but has never been in the limelight. This is especially the case for dynamic pieces that evolve over time. People have put up paintings, pictures and sculptures in their homes and museums but even with cheap LCD screens, very rarely displays of generative art.

Things are fundamentally different with NFTs on the block chain. Not only is the code to produce the pieces immutably stored, and the code to run it stored in an [Arctic Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/), but also each minted piece can be one of a kind to the original minter, setting parameters to produce works of art not even the creator has seen or imagined. When combined with the meta-verse, NFTs and generative artwork in particular are a powerful expression of human creativity and aesthetic. And this is just the beginning.

Inspired by the pioneers of crypto-native generative art like [Larva Labs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs) and [Deafbeef](https://www.deafbeef.com/), Blitz Generative has its own ERC721 smart contract to mint and sell its token, <em>Blitz</em>.

Our contract can be found [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5074ca50be4990163d18be797783f8aa7cb23be3) and is built off of open source, battle tested code from both [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and [Deafbeef](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd754937672300ae6708a51229112de4017810934#code). Having our own contract gives us full ownership of our work, without the fees and centralized control of NFT minting via [marketplaces](https://opensea.io/) -- antithetical to the decentralized dream of Satoshi Nakamoto. It also gives us complete artistic freedom to experiment with new ways of issuing tokens and ways to create art.

We are interested in helping to further open source the creation of NFTs outside of centralized minting contracts and are happy to help other interested artists in deploying their own work.

## FAQs

- Who is behind Blitz Generative?

Blitz Generative is a pseudo-anonymous researcher in artificial intelligence. Separate interests in generative art and blockchains met each other, fell in love, and Blitz Generative is their child.

- How do I obtain a Blitz art piece?

Mint one yourself by heading to the relevant series, connecting your MetaMask account, and clicking the purchase button. Stay on the screen to see how to generate the work yourself or wait for the results to be uploaded onto the website.

If all pieces are sold out then you may be able to find them on secondary marketplaces.

- What are the details of the Blitz Generative smart contract?

- What code is used to make the generative art pieces?

For the first series, p5.js is used. This is because it is Pareto optimal between great creative freedom and running in the web browser with just Javascript. p5.js will be a library that likely exists until the end of time because it is so popular that it has been stored in the GitHub [Arctic Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/).

> The archive is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault.
