{"description":"DEAFBEEF: Generative On-Chain Multimedia Art \n\nThe code and parameters to generate and reconstruct these multimedia files is stored on \nthe Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSeries 0 - Synth Poems - Token 1\n\nSynth Poems are 1min generative audiovisual pieces using FM synthesis, and XY oscilloscope visualization. Each entirely generated unsupervised by a self contained code model, which is stored on chain. \n\n<p> Frequency Modulation(FM) is a method that was used in broadcasting radio signals, later discovered to be useful for audio synthesis allowing a simply way to generate rich harmonic timbres. The left and right stereo audio channels are mapped to the XY inputs of a (virtual) oscilloscope to produce a direct visualization of the audio waveform. \n\n<p>  At the musical level, this generative algorithm plays with feedback to produce an evolving but balanced set of timbres and pitches.  Across pieces, a carefully selected set of rules govern the variation of tempos, time signatures, (in)harmonicity  resulting in individual pieces that are unique, while retaining a common theme.\n","external_url":"https:\/\/www.deafbeef.com\/item\/1","image":"https:\/\/www.deafbeef.com\/media\/1\/image.jpg?a=952","animation_url":"https:\/\/www.deafbeef.com\/media\/1\/audiovisual_opensea.mp4","name":"DEAFBEEF Series 0: Synth Poems - Token 1","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Series","value":"0"},{"trait_type":"Tempo","value":"Very Fast"},{"trait_type":"BPM","value":"771.07"},{"trait_type":"Tonality","value":"lydian"},{"trait_type":"Fundamental Freq","value":"66.287"},{"trait_type":"Beats per Measure","value":"12"},{"trait_type":"Pitch Pattern Length","value":"6"},{"trait_type":"Pitch Variability","value":"0"},{"trait_type":"Inharmonic","value":"No"}]}
