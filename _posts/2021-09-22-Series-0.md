<i>Growth and decay. Explosions and implosions. Sphere morphology.</i>

Video of it here from the first one that is minted.

With ... different parameters set from a hash combining your wallet address, the token ID and attributes of the block it is minted on, the time, ... and ..., every spike ball is unique. In fact, there are a total of ... possible variations (add footnote for calculation). The features the vary for each ball include:

* Implosion - Each spike ball has a 30% chance of immediately imploding without any growth stage.
* Ball size
* Ball vertices
* Growth speed
* Ball colour
* Ball stroke colour
* Background colour
* Lighting colour
* Rotation direction
* Rotation speed

## Explanation of the code:

Summary:
A sphere mesh is created out of lots of triangles. A random subset of the vertices are selected morph. Each vertex samples a random number with a small bias in probability towards either growth or decay.

Details:
An [isosphere]() is created by first creating a hexagon and resizing each point to exist on an [L2-norm]() sphere. Vertices are added to the sphere
